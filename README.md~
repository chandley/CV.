* I'm an experienced fund manager, interested in applying agile methods to finance.
* I love automating repetetive tasks, and testing software to be sure that it works
* Read my code on [GitHub].

Code examples

Web development
---------------

* Finance involves a lot of repetetive tasks which are suitable for automation. 
* I'm convinced that companies can get a competetive advantage by using TDD to build flexible and reliable software to meet evolving business needs.
* I decided to do a 12 week intensive course at Makers Academy to learn how to apply these.
