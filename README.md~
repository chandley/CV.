Web development

* Finance involves a lot of repetetive tasks which are suitable for automation. 
* I'm convinced that companies can get a competetive advantage by using TDD to build flexible and reliable software to meet evolving business needs.
* I decided to do a 12 week intensive course at Makers Academy to learn how to apply these
