I'm an experienced fund manager, interested in applying agile methods to finance.
I love automating repetetive tasks, and testing software to be sure that it works

Code examples
-------------

| [Hen Party App] | [Sudoku] | [Airport] |
|:--------------- |:-------- |:--------- |
| Rails MVP created in 10 days with [@Harrisam2] and [@jodiealaine] to make organising a hen party easier for maids of honour. | Sinatra web app to play Sudoku puzzles with a recursive algorithm to generate and solve puzzles. | 100% test-driven Ruby model of airports and planes written using RSpec with an emphasis on code readability. |


Web development
---------------

Finance involves a lot of repetetive tasks which are suitable for automation. I'm convinced that companies can
get a competetive advantage by using TDD to build flexible and reliable software to meet evolving business needs.
I decided to do a 12 week intensive course at Makers Academy to learn how to apply these.
